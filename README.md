# hello-world
This is my first repository in Github. Here, just like other programming newbie, I'll create an hello world project in either c++ or html (2 languages I am starting out with)

Hi, I'm Sway. I'm 24, male, and tech savy. I have a first degree in Mechanincal Engineering and I'm in the process of switching career paths to software and web development. I decided to pick c++ as my first programming language because I think I'll find it challenging. I've also decided to ditch software development and focus on web development if at any point I find c++ too difficult and I cant continue.
